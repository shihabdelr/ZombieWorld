# ZombieWorld
You wake up in a post-apocalyptic world that has been overrun by zombies. You check your phone and see this message from your friend: 'There are survivors in the hospital. If you're still alive, come immediately!!!!' What will you do next?

ZombieWorld is a game where you suddenly wake up in your room to a world full of zombies. Your friend informs you that many survivors are camping out in the hospital. Wether you go to the hospital or not is your choice. You can choose to camp out in your house, or try to meet with the others. If you decide to go to the hospital, you are met with many obsticles, which include killing zombies, choosing weapons, and even deciding wether to save someone who is calling for help or not. In the end, there is only one way to make it to the hospital alive, so choose wisely.

This code contains 4 classes. The driver, room, adventure, and weapon. Each serve a self explanitory purpose. This code is similar to the code which I used in lab 12. There are comments in the code which take you through every step taken and what my thought proccess was.

Thank you for playing!
